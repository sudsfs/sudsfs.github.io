<div style="text-align: justify">
Progress in modern research depends on our ability to analyse and interpret data with complex models to derive meaningful insights and conclusions. This approach is usually collectively referred to under the umbrella term of 'Data Science'.
<p>
We are convinced that building a local community of researchers interested in Data Science would help to develop cross-disciplinary collaborations
fostering knowledge and methodology transfer across the different disciplines. We note that these aspects have not usually been well represented in traditional curricula, and regular interaction can help keep everyone abreast of current research in a rapidly evolving field.
</p>
<p>
By providing this new interdisciplinary seminar, addressing topics in Data Science and information theory, we seek to bring together interested researchers from the various research areas present at Stockholm University. We are interested in establishing contact between them and building a local interdisciplinary community to address outstanding Data Science problems.
</p>
<p>
The seminar schedule will be filled with local and external speakers. Presentations from local speakers shall foster the interdisciplinary communication in Stockholm. External speakers shall provide cutting-edge information on the title topics and stimulate local discussions.
</p>
<p>
We invite you to actively join us in building a local Data Science community at Stockholm University, by attending our discussions, proposing speakers
and suggesting interesting topics to be covered in this seminar series.
