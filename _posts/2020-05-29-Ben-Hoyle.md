I will present an overview into a few of the many data-science related projects and techniques being undertaken at Zeiss. 
I will then concentrate on two data-science applications; one using a nice application of Bayesâ€™ theorem together with ML, applied to the problem 
of Pupil-Distance estimation in an ophthalmology context, the other, predicting the memory consumption of a computing cluster.
