Particle physics experiments often use toy simulations to estimate their signal and background models. The cost of these increases exponentially with the number of observable dimensions and inference parameters. However, the density these simulations approximate can often be computed directly at any observed event using tensor multiplication. This talk shows how to use this technique to increase the dimensionality (and therefore sensitivity) of the likelihood of XENON1T, the world's most sensitive direct dark matter search experiment.
